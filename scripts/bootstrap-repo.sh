# which would have clobbered the numbered Obsidian vault this repository actually uses
# (docs/02-adr/001-repo-bootstrap-decisions.md D3).
#
# This is a scaffolding helper, not part of verification. `just bootstrap` installs tooling
# and creates the development database; this script only fills in missing directories.

Crate manifests and lib.rs files are NOT generated here — they are committed source, not
scaffolding. Next steps on a fresh environment:
  just bootstrap    install dev tooling and create the local development database
  just verify       Linux smoke
