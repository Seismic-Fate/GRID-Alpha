# straight through to the final "All checks passed." line, so `verify.sh Full` -- the exact
# capitalization every authority document prints -- ran zero checks and exited 0.
# verify.ps1 never had this hole: [ValidateSet("Full","Changed")] rejects bad input for it.

# Written at column 0 deliberately: check-verify-parity.sh extracts commands with
# `grep -E '^[[:space:]]+[a-zA-Z._/]'`, so an indented case arm would be read as a
# verification step and break parity with the justfile.
