# Scan for secret material.
#
# A security control MUST FAIL CLOSED. Every git invocation below aborts the run on error
# rather than reporting a clean scan over content that was never examined.
#
# Regression (found by adversarial review of PR #1): the base fallback used an empty-tree
# sentinel with `git diff <tree>...HEAD`. `...` requires two COMMITS, so git aborted with
# "Invalid symmetric difference expression"; a `|| true` swallowed the fatal and the guard
# printed OK with exit 0 while a committed ghp_ token sat in the tree. When no base commit
# is available the script now scans the ENTIRE tracked tree instead.
#
# Patterns live in scripts/secret-patterns.txt. That file and this one are excluded from the
# diff/tree/untracked passes so the detector cannot trigger on its own definitions -- but they
# are NOT unscanned. They were, and that made them the one place in the repository where a
# secret was never looked for (second adversarial review, minor 4). They now get a dedicated
# pass of their own, in full, on every run and in every mode. Inside that pass only, a line
# carrying the marker `# nosecret` is skipped, so a pattern that legitimately matches itself
# can be exempted line by line instead of exempting two whole files.
#
# The marker has no effect anywhere else: it is applied only to these two paths, so it cannot
# become a way to smuggle a secret past the scanner from ordinary source.
#
# Usage: check-secrets.sh [base-ref]     (default: origin/main)

# THE EMPTY-SCAN GUARD LIVES HERE, INSIDE THE FUNCTION, NOT AT THE CALL SITES.
#
# That placement is the whole point, and it was learned the hard way. Round 2 found scan_files
# opening zero of the files handed to it on Windows, and the fix added a guard -- to the one
# call site that had failed. Round 3 then found the OTHER call site (untracked files) unguarded
# in both arms of the if below: diff mode never checked it at all, and in full-tree mode the
# call-site guard runs BEFORE the untracked scan, so it only ever counted the tracked pass.
# Same defect, third instance, because each fix was applied to the instance and not to the shape.
#
# A guard at a call site protects that one call. A guard inside the function protects every
# call, including ones nobody has written yet.
#
# `f="${f%$'\r'}"`: a carriage return on a path silently fails the -f test, so the file is
# skipped and the scan reports a clean corpus over content it never opened. That is the exact
# mechanism that blinded the Windows merge gate.
